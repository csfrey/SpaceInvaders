# Space Invaders

You know it, you love it. This project is a very basic recreation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. It is not the first game the devs have ever made, but it is the first time they've written one from scratch.

Developed by [Charlie Frey](https://github.com/csfrey) and [Casey Etling](https://github.com/callmecasey).

## Project Goals

"First, make it work. Then, make it work better." - Charlie's boss Eric, 2015

### Phase 1

Build one playable level of Space Invaders, with a start menu and a pause menu. Deploy the game in WebAssembly on a live server.

### Phase 2

Update the game for endless waves of enemies while the player survives. Implement a scoring system and a leaderboard.

## Metagoals

Learn modern C++ and essential gamedev principles. Mentor Casey in programming best practices. Have a playable game in our portfolios.
